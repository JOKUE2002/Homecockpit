Send these codes from your Arduino with a 'Serial.println'
(The data burst needs to end with a linefeed)
There is nothing else for you to do. It will go to FSX automatically.
Some of these may not work on some planes. (Test them to check they work)

Simconnect direct injection codes.

Below are the codes you would send from the Arduino to do the required command.
You only need to send it once.
Make sure they are sent with "Serial.println(code)" command.
Note the println ,, as this sends the required linefeed after the code.

Examples ,,,
To raise the gear ,,,
Serial.println("C01");

To lower the gear ,,
Serial.println("C02");

To turn the autopilot on ,,
Serial.println("B03");

To set the transponder to 3254 ,,
Serial.println("A423254");

Make sure it's a capital letter.
This has nothing to do with the "Keys" section.
Just send the code from the Arduino and it will happen.
Easy, isn't it.?????

As mentioned above, some of these may not work on some planes.
Don't blame me ,, some planes are not set up 100% for simconnect ,,,
even M$ with the Baron ,, the de-ice wont work ,,
so TEST  THEM  FIRST before coding the Arduino for a particular planes function.

Also note ,,,
Some knobs or switches that appear to not work, actually may be working because 
the developer has not added the code to change the visual switch that you see.
Also if "X" wont work ,,, check that "Y" (and maybe "Z") is in the 'on' (or off) 
position first as some simconnect commands do away with the automatic 
'systems' stuff that happens for the casual user.
